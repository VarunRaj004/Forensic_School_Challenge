A suspicious .pcap file was pulled from a compromised developer machine during a late-night forensic sweep. The surface traffic? Boring. Clean. Almost too clean.

But you’re not here for surface-level analysis.

You’ve been tasked with peeling back the layers: decoding, deobfuscating, and dismissing the dozens of red herrings designed to distract you from the real threat.

Among fake flags and misleading echo commands, one hidden script contains the only true flag — cleverly encrypted and deeply buried where you'd least expect it.

Your mission:

Follow the trail of misdirection.

Recognize what’s noise and what’s signal.

Decode the only valid flag, hidden in plain sight.
