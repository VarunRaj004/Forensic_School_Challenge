Challenge: Optimize and Repair
ðŸ“œ Description
Your organization has detected suspicious traffic from an internal workstation (IP: 10.10.10.50). The traffic was captured in a PCAP file by the SOC (Security Operations Center) and handed over to you.

The initial indicators suggest the user was downloading performance tools and update patches from seemingly legitimate domains. However, thereâ€™s a strong suspicion that a reverse shell was established, and data exfiltration may have occurred â€” possibly through DNS tunneling or covert channels.

Your mission is to:

Analyze the traffic.

Identify any malicious payloads.

Determine if a flag was exfiltrated.

Submit the exfiltrated flag as proof of compromise.
